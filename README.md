Here's a GitHub Markdown document summarizing the JFramework C++ framework and its unit tests:

# JFramework - A C++ Application Framework

## Overview
JFramework is a C++ framework that provides a structured architecture for building applications with components like Models, Systems, Commands, Queries, and Events. It follows an Inversion of Control (IoC) pattern and supports event-driven programming.

## Key Features

### Core Components
- **IOC Container**: Manages component lifecycle and dependencies
- **Event Bus**: Handles event publishing/subscribing
- **Command Pattern**: For executing operations
- **Query Pattern**: For data retrieval
- **Bindable Properties**: Observable properties with change notifications

### Component Types
- **Models**: Data containers
- **Systems**: Business logic processors
- **Controllers**: Mediators between models and views
- **Utilities**: Shared services
